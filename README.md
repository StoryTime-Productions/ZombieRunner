## Description

ZombieRunner is a 3D game developed using the Unity Engine. This game features common aspects in FPS-games and the use of Unity's built-in modeling package ProBuilder to model a level.

## Features

- Player can be controlled with WASD and equip three weapons, each with their own ammo
- Zombies spawn around the map, and have animations for walking, remaining idle, attacking and dying.
- A level built using Unity's ProBuilder package and scripting to bring the game together.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the project in Unity Game Engine (Unity Editor).

The game is solely meant for learning purposes and is not planned to be released to major platforms, unless significant and unique features are implemented.

## How to Play

- Use WASD to navigate yourself around the map, and shoot zombies using left-mouse-button (LMB).
- Switch between your weapons either using the keys 1, 2, and 3, or the scroll-wheel on a mouse.
- One of the weapons allows you to use its scope using the right-mouse-button (RMB).
